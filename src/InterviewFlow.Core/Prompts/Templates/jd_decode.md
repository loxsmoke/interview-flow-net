# JD Decode

Analyzes a job description through six interpretive lenses to surface hidden priorities and signals.

## Description

Used by the JD Analysis agent to decode what a job posting really means beyond its surface text. Examines repetition frequency, emphasis order, required vs. nice-to-have items, verb choices, corporate-speak signals, and notable omissions. Ends with a plain-language role summary and potential concerns.

## Fields

- `{job_posting}` — The raw job description text to analyze

Analyze this job description through six lenses:

1. **Repetition Frequency** — What words/phrases appear most? These reveal true priorities.
2. **Order & Emphasis** — What's listed first? What gets the most text? This shows what they care about most.
3. **Required vs Nice-to-Have** — Separate hard requirements from wish-list items. Be precise.
4. **Verb Choices** — Active verbs ("build", "lead", "own") vs passive ("support", "assist", "contribute") reveal the role's real scope.
5. **Between-the-Lines Signals** — What do phrases like "fast-paced", "wear many hats", "self-starter" actually mean? Decode the corporate speak.
6. **What's Missing** — What's conspicuously absent? No mention of work-life balance? No growth path? No team size?

For each finding, tag confidence: [HIGH] [MEDIUM] [LOW]

Visualization rules:
- **Lenses 2, 3, and 4** — use a markdown table instead of a diagram. Column headers name each category; cells list phrases one per line separated by `<br>` (not commas). Examples:
  - Lens 2: `| What's Listed First | Middle Emphasis | Low Emphasis |`
  - Lens 3: `| Hard Requirements | Nice to Have |`
  - Lens 4: `| High-Agency Verbs | Low-Agency Verbs |`
- **Any summary or synthesis section** — use a markdown table instead of a diagram. Column headers should name the categories being compared (e.g. `| Signal | What It Means | Confidence |`).
- **Other lenses** — when a diagram genuinely aids understanding, use a Mermaid diagram (```mermaid code block). Never use ASCII art. Do NOT use `block-beta` — use `graph LR` for side-by-side comparisons. Do NOT use HTML tags inside node labels — use `\n` for line breaks. Never use backtick-quoted labels (e.g. `` A["`...`"] ``) — they trigger Mermaid's markdown-string parser, which does not support list syntax and will render the error text "Unsupported markdown: list" literally inside the diagram. Never put `- `, `* `, or numbered list markers inside any node label. Add `direction TB` as the first line inside any subgraph that contains multiple nodes so items stack vertically.

Provide a structured analysis with all six lenses, then end with:
- **The Role in One Sentence** — What this job actually is, decoded
- **Hidden Requirements** — What they want but didn't explicitly say
- **Potential Concerns** — Things the JD reveals that a candidate should ask about
